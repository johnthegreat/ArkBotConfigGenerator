## Instructions

- You will need to host this on a webserver (e.g. Apache, nginx, etc.) due to CORS security issues.
- Once the code is on your webserver, open `index.html`.
- Use the web form to fill in the appropriate values. Optionally, you can import from an existing config file. To do so, click on the "Import from Existing Config" button.
- Once you've made all desired changes, click on the "Copy to Clipboard" and the browser will attempt to add the generated config to your clipboard so you can paste it into your config file.
